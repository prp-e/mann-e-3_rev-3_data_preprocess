# Data preprocess procedure for Mann-E 3

_[Mann-E](https://opencognitives.com/mann-e)_ is a _text to image model_ which was developed by [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) and is a part of the [Open Cognitives](https://opencognitives.com) or Web 4.0 project. 

The main goal of this project is to bring the artistic ideas of people to life with ease and as a part of _FLOSS_ software. Also this project will let scientists and researchers do their researches about human mind in a much easier and simpler way than the past.

## What is this repository about?

This repository is a somehow failed attempt to gather data from images generated using [Midjourney AI](https://midjourney.com) for studying prompts and stuff. This project is failed not because the approach taken was wrong, it's been failed because the data came from old versions of the art generator and then, it didn't contribute too much to Mann-E project.
